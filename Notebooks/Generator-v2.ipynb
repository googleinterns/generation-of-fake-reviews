Texture is amazingly close, but better in its own way. The best Chinese food I ever had here in Phoenix. I came in for their soft opening and I was impressed by how many types of Udon they offered. 3. I like vegetable pho, which isnhard to find, most places dont even have this option available. Orange Chicken- who would know it wasn't with real chicken! For an asian buffet? Because you won't be disappointed on how delicious their food is! This food is very good! Their crab Rangoon are sized as they should be, large triangle wantons, as opposed to other places in vegas that give you barely a dime sized amount of crab in a fancy shaped wonton. Oh, by the way, this wonderful dish is only $10, totally worthy! Being newish to the area I have no idea if it's big by CLT standards but it's big for NYC Chinatown. The noodles, soaked in this, went down smooth and hit the spot in ways I did not think possible. \n","\n","Sample negative review: \n","Forgot drink requests, took too long to check-in with us, never presented dessert menu (which was finally offered by a bus boy). Bread was only cooked partially as one end was still doughy. i have never eaten anything worse than this, it dose even taste like food and the service is so bad. because he heard the whole conversation, I am like just take it. I was truly disappointment I was $43 plus tips. Rude staff, it is an insult to Afghan traditional food. Sorry to say I don't think it will be around for the long haul. I can't remember his name or I would definitely call the restaurant about him because he was not only rude to me and my friends, but to a fellow bartender. The dessert might have been the greatest thing west of the goddamn Mississippi; however, I shall never know. \n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"IPfNO4rs2JpG","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":17},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1591082481053,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1608,"user":{"displayName":"Ishwarya Sivakumar","photoUrl":"","userId":"02628689146101986402"}},"outputId":"71ee1d78-c526-496a-9f6e-fd2bfed2b8d3"},"source":["#merge both the review_lists as one.
